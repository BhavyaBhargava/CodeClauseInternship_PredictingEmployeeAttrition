    "# Data Preparation for Predicting Employee Attrition \n",
    "*By Bhavya Bhargava*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee attrition prediction is crucial for organizations aiming to maintain a strong and committed workforce. By leveraging data-driven insights, HR analysts can identify key factors that influence employee departures and take proactive steps to improve retention. Preparing the IBM employee attrition dataset is a critical step in this process, ensuring that the data is clean, structured, and ready for meaningful analysis. Proper data preparation—such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features—enhances model accuracy and reliability. By refining the dataset, we can build predictive models that help HR teams make informed decisions, reduce turnover costs, and create a more engaged work environment.\n",
